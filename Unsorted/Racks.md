# Racks

## Overview

### Introduction

This document serves as a source of general information with regard to server racks. A Server rack is a standardized metal frame/enclosure for mounting various pieces of equipment but for our purposes this will mostly consist of servers, switches, and a few other pieces of gear.

### Rack Units

A Rack Unit, often abbreviated as 'U' is a unit of measure defined as 1.75 inches or 44.45 millimeters. This unit is most frequently used as a measure of the overall height of a 19 inch rack as well as the height of individual pieces of equipment mounted inside the rack.

### Rack Holes

You'll typically find that racks come in one of two configurations as far as holes are concerned. Those with round holes and those with square holes. If you're going to be purchasing a rack it is highly recommended that you look for one with square holes.
